I paint women finding their talents and passions, channeling their own individuality through arts, fashion, music, and other media. I celebrate women who embraced their differences and found their voices.\n\nI create pen drawings which I later add watercolor paint to, making my marks complex and intentional. I start with simple outlines, and then add detail using various types of marks to make my figures and their surroundings realistic and interesting.\n\nIn “Woodstock”, my pen marks are clean and light. The limited amount of shading allows my audience to feel the light and warmth, similar to the mellow nature of the depicted environment.\n\nI was hesitant to add color, but I found color contributes to the meaning within each piece. I’m exploring the idea of self expression and creative freedom- using color seems very fitting, and it helps to make the women I paint more individual.\n\nI often use colors with a vintage feel, dull colors that make some works appear faded and old. Most of my pieces are images that I imagine may have taken place between the 50’s and 90’s. Through color I remind my audience of the time period. In “Polaroid”, I use colors I associate with the 70’s and hope my audience sees this connection as well.\n\nAll of my paintings are simply moments. Sometimes very small moments are memorable and defining. I hope to capture the feelings and energy of a moment that is hard to describe in words."}},"13":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens, 14x14 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Untitled, acrylic paint, 20 x 20 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Untitled, prismacolor marker, 10 x 14 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Untitled, color pencils, 14 x 17 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, color pencils, acrylic paint, 16 x 22 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, color pencils, acrylic paint, 22 x 19 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, color pencils - closeup, acrylic paint, 22 x 19 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untilied, color pencils, acrylic paint, 21 x 13 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Untitled, color pencils, acrylic paint, 19x 24 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Untitled closeup, color pencils, acrylic paint, 19x 24 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, pencil, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, acrylic paint on wood, 12x12 inches ©2019","type":"image"}},"link":[0,8],"name":"Jacky Li","statement":{"type":"text","content":"In my art, I explore the complexity of human communication through the unconscious contrasts between thoughts and apparent expressions.

Ambiguity of the subjects allows the meaning within each piece to be a projection of the ideology of the viewer.\n\nThroughout the creation of the pieces in my concentration, I developed methods to demonstrate my intended concept.\n\nBy creating each piece without a representational background, the centers of each piece can be seen differently by each viewer. Since the viewer can place it somewhere within their own interactions with the world, they are able to relate to each piece more readily. The concept of each piece is to allow the viewer to reflect on the impacts of their actions on the beings in the pictures, whether constructive or destructive. Not showing what the impact is forces a viewer to think of what their individual impact could be, and how far their actions reach in nature. Though we individually are not responsible for the actions of humanity as a whole, we as a society use animals for personal gain, not thinking of the impact on their lives. We rarely stop to consider the intricate workings of the world that allow us to exist in the way that we do. We have a mutually constructive and destructive relationship with Earth that we could not survive without."}},"21":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Abuelita, oil paint, 18x18 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Tony, acrylic paint, 20x28 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Your Blues Turn Gold, oil paint, 16x12 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Side Effects, colored pencil, 11.5x7.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Words Hurt, mixed material, 8x8.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"death=handcuffs, copic marker, 9x8.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Moving On, acrylic paint, 20x28 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"SMILE!, graphite pencil, 3.5x5.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Queen of Boredom, charcoal, 18x12 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Bright Colors, Big City, watercolor, 11x11 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Wind Up, oil paint, 20x30 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Soul’s Windows, oil paint, 8x24 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Anxiety Monster, watercolor and ink, 3x4 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Feeling Anxious, watercolor and ink, 10x8 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Fight, watercolor and ink, 11x7.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Flight, watercolor and ink, 5x11 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Bipolar Monster, watercolor and ink, 2x3 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Feeling Bipolar, watercolor and ink, 8.5x11 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Manic Half, watercolor and ink, 8.5x4 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Depressed Half, watercolor and ink, 8.5x4 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Depression Monster, watercolor and ink 6x3 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Feeling Depressed, watercolor and ink, 8.5x10 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Dirty Laundry, watercolor and ink, 11x8.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Food Overload, watercolor and ink, 11x8.5 inches ©2019","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Raquel Ruiz","statement":{"type":"text","content":"My concentration encourages a conversation about mental health by attempting to create a common understanding between those that suffer and the viewer.

For example, in the drawing of an alligator surrounded by alligator-leather wrist watches, both the product and the animal have the same characteristic feature — alligator skin. The big, magnificent animal is sacrificed and turned into a smaller, more delicate product, keeping its natural characteristic intact for profit. Through this, I wanted to investigate the power of juxtaposition by contrasting living creatures and products that are interconnected through the same drawing marks and patterns.\n\nContact: jimmypark1223@gmail.com"}},"26":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 14x10 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 10x8 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 14x10 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 10x8 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 20x14 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 10x6 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 14x10 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 14x10 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 20x14 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Untitled, micron pen on paper, 20x14 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper,  14x10 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, micron pens on paper, 14x10 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Self Portrait, oil paint on canvas, 20x20 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Primary Colors Meet, oil paint on wood frame, 24x20 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Colorful Chaos, micron pen and sharpie on paper, 16½x13½ inches ©2018","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Pupper, watercolor on paper,10x8 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Betta Fish, copic markers on paper, 11½x19  inches ©2018","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Portugal, oil paint on canvas, 20x20 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Bodies are Just Shapes, charcoal on paper, 10x8 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Hair, oil paint on canvas, 16x12 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Rainbow Soup, oil pastel on paper, 8½x7  inches ©2018","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Thick and Creamy, acrylic paint and modeling paste on wood, 14x9¼ inches ©2018","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Got the Purples, watercolor on paper, 14x6 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Cat-i, micron pen on paper, 10x8 inches ©2018","type":"image"}},"link":[0,8],"name":"Arcadia Wisnik","statement":{"type":"text","content":"Daily life can often be hectic and stressful.

All organisms share the same wish, which is to survive, whether they grow from the earth or tread upon it.\n\nContact: mjtatananni@gmail.com"}},"29":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Caged, micron pen on paper, 18x24 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Chickens, micron pen on paper, 16x24 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Chickens (closeup), micron pen on paper, 18x24 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Lambs, micron pen on paper, 15x20 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Cow , micron pen on paper, 15x20 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Cow (closeup), micron pen on paper, 15x20 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Gutter , micron pen on paper, 15x15 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Hoof , micron pen on paper, 20x15 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Fishy, micron pen on paper, 15x15 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Lobster, micron pen on paper, 20x15 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Chick, micron pen on paper, 20x15 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Plucked, micron pen on paper, 20x15 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Vacation, oil on canvas, 24x18 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Italy, oil on canvas, 9x12 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Self-Portrait, oil on canvas, 24x18 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Italy, gouache, 14x10 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Flowers - ink on paper, 28x20 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Lemon, colored pencils on paper, 18x9 inches ©2018","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Leaves, colored pencils on paper, 18x9 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Man on the Docks, white charcoal and china marker on brown paper, 28x20 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Joyce Carol Oates, oil stick on paper, 28x20 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Gaze, oil on canvas, 20x16 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Hidden- ink on paper, 11x12 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"The Eye, marker on paper, 11x12 inches ©2017","type":"image"}},"link":[1,17],"name":"Claire Lazarus","statement":{"type":"text","content":"My art is a reflection of the experiences and hardships I have been through.

My other works were very explorative and educational but by painting a concentration, I was able to learn how to work with one concept and really focus on portraying it.\n\nContact: srnadasi@gmail.com"}},"39":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]},{"name":"3","order":[24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]},{"name":"4","order":[36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Untitled, copic markers,  16x20 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"I Love You Even If, digital photography and photoshop, 55x100 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"American Dream, watercolor,5x4 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Surveil, charcoal, 24x18 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Privliage, oil paint, 14x11  inches ©2016","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, pen, 18x14 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, pen, 18x14 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, colored pencil, 11x8.5  inches ©2016","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Untitled, marker and photoshop,4x12 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Untitled, pen, 16x12 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, photoshop ©2016","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, pen,  14x18 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Glow Girl, copic markers & ink,  8.5x11 inches ©2017","type":"image"},"24":{"name":"Self-Portrait, copic markers on water color paper, pins & wood,  16x12 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"25":{"name":"Car, charcoal,, 18x24 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"26":{"name":"Untitled, acrykic on canvas, 6x4 feet ©2016","type":"image"},"27":{"name":"Imogen, oil on canvas, 10x8 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"28":{"name":"Untitled, ink on paper, 18x24 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"29":{"name":"Untitled, oil on canvas, 24x18 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"30":{"name":"Untitled, markers on paper, 12x18 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"31":{"name":"Untitled, watercolor on paper, 12x18 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"32":{"name":"Green Eye, oil on canvas, 18x24 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"33":{"name":"Mayya, watercolor, 22x30 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"34":{"name":"Patrick & Eccles, oil on canvas, 24x30 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"35":{"name":"Untitled, colored pencils, 18x24 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"36":{"name":"Simon, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"37":{"name":"Simon, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"38":{"name":"Jason, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"39":{"name":"Hope - detail, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"40":{"name":"Emma, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"41":{"name":"Joelle, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"42":{"name":"Wendy, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"43":{"name":"Simon - detail,, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"44":{"name":"Julia, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"45":{"name":"Eccles, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"46":{"name":"Hope, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"47":{"name":"Spencer - detail, ink on bristol board, 14x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"}},"link":[1,12],"name":"Rebecca Mesonjnik","statement":{"type":"text","content":"Throughout life, especially in high school, people judge each other based on appearance.

Each image depicts how the sun set differs in vibrancy and color correlating to the time that the sun sets as the year progresses. I twisted photos of the sun set along the Hudson River into a circle, then created a clock face depicting the time the sun set that night. They are arranged in chronological order: sun sets earlier in the day/year are placed before sun sets later in the year. Each piece between the clock's hands contains a washed out section of color to further emphasis the movement and fluidity of a sun set.\n\nGALLERY III\n\nI studied how reflections are illusions, nonexistent objects and empty, contrary to how they appear. Each piece depicts a ring of mountains with a body of water in the center reflecting the land. While the land contains depth, I kept the reflections flat to symbolize how reflections, however mirror-like they appear in nature, are in fact fake and untouchable unlike the surrounding land. For each piece, I took standard mountainscapes and twisted the mountains in on themselves, creating a ring of land around a body of water. I painted the reflections in the water solid and flat in contrast to the mountains which are painted realistically. The color schemes of each are entirely possible in nature, however fantastical they may seem. The circular forms enhance their transcendental appearance.\n\nContact: m.mcloughlin87@gmail.com"}},"42":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Untitled, mixed media on wood, 24x20 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Untitled, mixed media on wood, 20.5x17 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Untitled, mixed media on wood, 20.5x20.5 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"no.1, mixed media on wood, 26x23.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, mixed media, 35x40 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, graphite on paper, 10x11.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, watercolor on paper, 13.5x14 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 7x10 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 8x8 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 8x8 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 7x10 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 7x10 inches ©2016","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Cleo Davidowitz","statement":{"type":"text","content":"My mixed media works convey the intensity and pain of the human condition through the physical manifestation of \"scars\".

After painting realistically for multiple years, I have made a stylistic move to non-realistic work intended to convey raw emotions using only brush strokes, minimal text and aesthetics.\n\nContact: gsieg99@yahoo.com\n\nContact: gsieg99@yahoo.com"}},"46":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]},{"name":"Video","order":[24,25,26,27,28,29]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"film still ©2016","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Still from the film The Matchmakers ©2015","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Still from the film Apocalypse Dreams ©2015","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Still from the film Apocalypse Dreams ©2015","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Still from the film Apocalypse Dreams ©2015","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Still from the film The Catfish ©2015","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Still from the film The Catfish ©2015","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Still from the film The Catfish ©2015","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Still from the film The Catfish ©2015","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Still from the film I Dig ©2015","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Still from the film I Dig  ©2015","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Still from the film Round Trip ©2015","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Still from the film Yearn ©2015","type":"image"},"24":{"name":"One Way (A Short Film About Time Travel) ©2015","type":"video","embed":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzL_b-Lx2Ks"},"25":{"name":"Yearn Yearn ©2015","type":"video","embed":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXCCEC6U3UM"},"26":{"name":"Rodney James - I Dig ©2015","type":"video","embed":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9KgLG2m8C0"},"27":{"name":"Tame Impala - Apocalypse Dreams ©2014","type":"video","embed":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMgUqL8HwVw"},"28":{"name":"Catfish ©2015","type":"video","embed":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6cVpEbSKoY"},"29":{"name":"The Matchmakers ©2014","type":"video","embed":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZ9oAKLJw5o?feature=player_detailpage"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Peter-Alexander Eccles","statement":{"type":"text","content":"In my junior year, I first began to work with video as an artistic medium with the idea of yearning for and romanticizing the past as my central conceptual focus. Most if not all of my pieces analyzed either the nature of nostalgia as a function of the human condition or its counterpart- the impact that our false recollections of the past have on our present day happiness and desire to replicate past memories (past love and purity of childhood). During this time, I witnessed a unique artistic phenomenon exclusive to the nature of my medium as my message and self-expression began to reach relatively large masses in my school through social media outlets, which empowered my formally introverted self. This year, I decided to dig deeper into this central theme by including myself in my artwork, examining my newfound self-absorption under this lens and preoccupation with recreating the feeling of being in last year’s spotlight. On a large scale, my artwork represents the nature of the Internet as a corruptive force, nurturing the self-importance and the attention-seeking obsession that's prominent in our generation.\n\nContact: peteraeccles@gmail.com"}},"47":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Decorated, acrylic on paper, 12x8 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Craziness is Like Heaven, ink on paper, 10x16 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"August, graphite on paper, 10x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Untitled, mixed media on paper, 24x18 inches ©2016","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Dog, acrylic on canvas, 18x24 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, graphite on paper, 10x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, graphite on paper, 10x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, oil on canvas, 16x18 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Whirlpools, acrylic on paper, 16x11 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Backyard, oil on canvas board, 16x11 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, modeling paste and string on paper, 14x18 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Thirteen, oil on canvas, 12x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"}},"link":[0,4],"name":"Kate Leahey","statement":{"type":"text","content":"\"This is my simple religion.

However, the process of creating art can not always be seen. My collage work this year has been focused on recycling-based efforts. Throughout the school year, I have incorporated a sustainable approach to my creation process. All of the canvases I work over are disregarded projects of past students. Additionally, almost all of the scraps that make up the pieces are from old copies of The New York Times (with the exception of childhood comic books and greeting cards). I feel this approach not only minimizes waste, but creates a new vitality to the materials used. A sloppily done portrait now takes on the life of another individual's creative abstraction, and a model for a hair product can be the centerpiece to a non-commercial production. I feel this reseizing of purpose creates a “forgive and forget” type mentality, in which a perceived purpose of something does not limit its potential functions.\n\nContact: ndjr14@gmail.com"}},"53":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Sierra, Drew, Sammy, Spencer, Emma, Sydney, oil paint and ink, 10x12 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Leftovers, acrylic, 20x30 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Breaking Out, ink, 12x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Memories on Film, watercolor and collage, 16x12 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Layers, crepe paper, 11x8.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Treasure, pencil, 8x7.5 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Chai, watercolor, 6.5x8.5 inches ©2012","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Manequinn, pencil, 7.5x8.75 inches ©2012","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Slipping Away, ink and photo, 16.5x12 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Live Music, oil paint, 12x9 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Cupcake, white charcoal, 9x9 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Kindergarten Self Portrait, colored pencil, 12x16 inches ©2003","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Hope Fourie","statement":{"type":"text","content":"Throughout all my work, I convey some sense of humor or hope.

To her, the choice to work with autistic students was an important and a personal one as these students remind her of her own children. Unfortunately, from society’s perspective, her laudable passion is nothing more than ink on skin.\n\nContact: nithu324@gmail.com"}},"57":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Addict, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Anxiety, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Bruised, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Drag Queen, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Disordered, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Oppressed, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Plasty Surgery, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Wannabe, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Stripper, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Stripper detail, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Beauty Queen, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Beauty Queen Detail, ink & marker on bristol board, 17x14.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Tears, watercolor pencil on watercolor paper, 7x10 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Mom and Ethan, pencil on paper, 4x8 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Jolie, oil pastels on paper, 11x5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Bones, pencil on white paper. 12x9 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Kate, ink, marker, paint pen, & paint on paper, 11x5.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Wolf, marker on paper, 12x9 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Alex, white charcoal on black paper, 8.5x8 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Roscoe, watercolor paint on watercolor paper, 11x10 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Rosie, colored pencil on paper, 10x10 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Justin, pencil on paper, 12x15 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Me, oil paint on canvas, 18x20 inches ©2015","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Hands, pencil & charcoal on paper, 10x9.5 inches ©2015","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Emmarose Turett","statement":{"type":"text","content":"The central idea of my concentration is that there is more to women than what you see.

Through my art I take this everyday, overlooked object and make people see it from a different perspective. I shrink characters to a smaller size in order for them relate to the object in a new way. At first, this might seem like a restriction, but instead the characters take their size into account and utilize the object in a manner that fulfills their necessities. Through each usage of the object, I express how creativity can also aid in the adaptability to different environments. To me, it is important that I keep a flexible mind when creating artwork. Anything could be art, and everything has the potential to be interesting and visually appealing. Something as plain as a glass jar can be fun and creatively utilized. Creativity is an inborn quality in everyone, yet sometimes we lose our grasp of it. My pieces act as a reminder to me that an artist has the ability to make any circumstance a piece of artwork, but it is up to the artist to dig past the seemingly meaningless and unappealing aspect of a subject.

But what intrigued me most were the Islamic use of words in art. Words are used in place of pictures. Words are given the same power that pictures have. Because just like pictures; words can have unlimited potential. I began to study words, not in context of literature or language arts, but for the value of words themselves. Inspired by the Surrealist painter Magritte who liberated words from their meanings, I began to play with how a word sounded; the make up of the word; and how that word looked and shaped.

They are over edited and almost always photoshopped. “Natural” now means a face full of makeup, and the “perfect body” is one that is close to skin and bones. Every aspect of the “perfect body” portrayed by the media sets a standard that is completely unobtainable; editors add curves and thigh gaps, take away blemishes, scars, and body hair, essentially creating a person different than the original human model. Recently media critics have sought to expose the truth behind photo editing. This inspired me to photograph portraits of my friends showing the difference between what real girls look like and what girls in magazines looks like. I had each model remove all of their makeup and jewelry and wear plain clothes. The models posed outside holding a magazine cutout of half a face, or a facial feature up to the corresponding body part.\n\nI chose this setup because I want to contrast nature and natural people with studio photography. I also want to show a contrast between natural sun light, studio lights, and the difference that lighting makes in a photograph. In advertisements, models often wear clothes not suitable for the weather. For example, models are frequently seen wearing bathing suits in the snow or jackets in the summer. My photographs were taken in all different seasons. I encouraged each model to dress appropriately depending on the weather. My images show people affected by nature- unlike the models who stand, seemingly unaffected, in next to nothing in the middle of winter. In some photos taken during the winter, my models’ nose might be a bit red from the cold or if the sun was shining brightly, they might be squinting. My art exhibits my belief that true beauty exists in these things labeled as “imperfections”."}},"65":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Gugg, tempra, 22x30 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Shall We, charcoal, 18 \"x 12\" ©2012","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Green Tea, mixed media, 8.5 \"x 11\" ©2012","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Picnic of the Reds, mixed media, 7 \"x 11\" ©2012","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"2036, mized media, 8.5 \"x 11\" ©2012","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Eyes, 8.5 \"x 5.5 ©2013","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Cosmopolitan, mixed media, 5\" x 7\", ©2012","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Paran Face, watercolor, 8 \"x 11\" ©2012","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"House of Cards, ink, 7 \"x 7\" ©2012","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Reading, photographyl, 8 \"x 11\" ©2012","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"The Reign of Fall, photography, 8\" x 10\", ©2012","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Inundation, watercolor, newspaper, acrylic, sharpie, 11x14 inches ©2013-14","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Seung Hee Kim","statement":{"type":"text","content":"In a world where the importance of a critical event is diluted by not only the number of events we are informed of, but also the frequency at which we receive information regarding events, our capability to empathize is inhibited. The main victim of the speedily disseminated information is the millennial generation, which I am part of. In my work I draw upon my experience with the media and it’s ways of inundating our daily lives, hence causing people to grow indifferent towards current issues.\n\nHuman eyes are naturally drawn to texts because our brains are trained to recognize and linguistically understand them. I cut out texts from newspaper and arranged them in a specific way so that the words, when read together almost seem to make sense, but ultimately mean nothing. Initial intrigue followed by the realization of ultimately meaningless text reflects my own experience. When I read or hear about a current issue, I am intrigued, but by the end of the day, the issue does not mean much. Today’s headlines will soon be irrelevant and we have to keep moving along. I implied the stark reality of having to quickly move on from today’s events with the rough texture of the black acrylic paint.\n\nControversial events tend to bring about two opposing ideas. At the immediate moment we are exposed to an event through the media, we try to take a side. The event shows that something, someone, somehow is “good” or “bad”. However, these events are not so “black and white” as we want them to be. People are inherently multidimensional, but the media finds a way to make these individuals so flat and “black and white”.

The images I created with Sharpie are projections of the ideas they provoked whether they were entirely the product of the statement or a combination of it and my current situation in life. The acrylic behind the sharpie is a loose interpretation of the mood it provoked within me through a combination of color and stroke.

The pulchritude of my subjects is seemingly natural and wholesome, yet their beauty is actually quite contrived. Their eyes are inauthentically bright, their skin flawlessly smooth: exaggerated characteristics associated with youth and beauty. Society considers these traits mutually exclusive, yet the admiration we have for nature stems from its cyclical and ancient resilience.\n\nI used elements in nature that contradict the “young is beautiful” mentality. For the piece 9 (Leaves), I collected leaves that had fallen off of trees as winter was approaching. Although the autumnal changes of color occur at the end of a leaf’s life and when it is “old”, it is also when the leaf is most beautiful. I also chose to photograph girls who were just exiting puberty in order to capture the sense of vitality and beauty they emit as they blossom into adulthood. The elements selected for the pieces 11 (Feathers) and 4 (Butterflies) reflect this choice; the feathers of a baby bird are always much less sleek and impressive than those of their fully-grown parents. Similarly, a butterfly begins its life as a caterpillar and emerges as a beautiful creature after a transformation in its cocoon."}},"72":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]},{"name":"3","order":[24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Raven in shoe, mixed media, 18x18 inches © 2014","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Bi ke, graphite on paper, 16 x 20 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Bound, photography,10x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Safety, stained glass, 16x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, very mixed media, 24x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Rise, marker on paper, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"My glasses, graphite on paper, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Vision, mixed media and digital manipulation, 10x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Snowboard, adobe illustrator, 2x16 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Panda, watercolor on canvas, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Upon a sunset, stained glass, 15x12 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Connected, graphite on paper, 18x24 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Raven in shoe, mixed media, 18x18 inches © 2014","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Bi ke, graphite on paper, 16 x 20 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Bound, photography,10x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Safety, stained glass, 16x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Untitled, very mixed media, 24x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Rise, marker on paper, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"My glasses, graphite on paper, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Vision, mixed media and digital manipulation, 10x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Snowboard, adobe illustrator, 2x16 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Panda, watercolor on canvas, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Upon a sunset, stained glass, 15x12 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Connected, graphite on paper, 18x24 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"24":{"name":"Checkmate, graphite on paper, 5x7 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"25":{"name":"Magnification, graphite and marker on paper, 5x7 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"26":{"name":"Virus, graphite and marker on paper, 5x7 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"27":{"name":"Fibonacci, graphite and marker on paper, 5x7 inches ©2014©2014","type":"image"},"28":{"name":"Nature's connection, graphite and marker on paper, 10x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"29":{"name":"Caffeine, graphite and charcoal on paper, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"30":{"name":"Cut, graphite and marker on paper, 11x14 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"31":{"name":"Cut the addiction, graphite and charcoal on paper, 11x28 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"32":{"name":"Painted, graphite and charcoal on paper, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"33":{"name":"Vice, graphite and charcoal on paper, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"34":{"name":"Sight, graphite and charcoal on paper, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"35":{"name":"Slain, graphite and charcoal on paper, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"}},"link":[1,12],"name":"Justin Callaghan","statement":{"type":"text","content":"In my concentration I attempt to explore the metaphorical and physical ways in which synthetic creations act upon the natural world.

Piece 1 of my concentration shows a natural force dominating a synthetic creation. In this piece the king chess piece is fallen, symbolizing complete defeat, or as it is called in chess, checkmate. Image 4 explores how the Fibonacci sequence is represented in both by nature, and by human creations. Piece number 6 explores humanity’s relationship with coffee. We are controlled by it because many need it to function, but also because we grow it and allow it to exist in great quantities due to our addiction. This relationship is mutual, and therefore the background is evenly divided. The eyes emerging from a Smart phone in piece 11 demonstrates that technology has replaced our senses. Instead of seeing things through our own eyes we experience them vicariously through technology. Finally the 12th piece shows the death of man by means of his own creation. The sword through a human brain is representative of mankind killing the system that in inhabits, and therefore itself.\n\nContact @ justin.b.callaghan@gmail.com"}},"73":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Untitled, charcoal on paper, 24x18 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Untitled, charcoal on paper, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Untitled, pastell on paper, 18x12 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Untitled, pastell on paper, 24x18 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, acrylic on canvas, 40x40 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, acrylic on board, 10x12 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, photography, 11x8.5 inches S©2013","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, pen on paper, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Untitled, charcoal on Newsprint, 18x24 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Untitled, acrylic on canvas, 10x10 inches ©2014","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, digital photo, 11x8.5 inches ©2013","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, digital photo, 11x8.5 inches ©2013","type":"image"}},"link":[0,5],"name":"Marco Forlenza","statement":{"type":"image"}},"74":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]},{"name":"2","order":[12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Chaos, black and colored ink on paper, 14\" x 17\" ©2012","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Beauty, black and colored ink on bristol board, 14\" x 17\" ©2013","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Filth, black and colored ink on bristol board, 14\" x 17\" ©2013","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Captivity, black and colored ink on bristol board, 14\" x 17\" ©2013","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Strength, black and colored ink on bristol board, 14\" x 17\" ©2013","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Domesticity, black and colored ink on bristol board, 14\" x 17\" ©2013","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Ego, ink on bristol board, 14\" x 17\" ©2012","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, thread and ink on bristol board, 8\" x 10\" ©2013","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Iconography, ink on bristol board, 12\" x 9\" ©2013","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Knot, acrylic paint on canvas, 24\" x 16\" ©2013","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Still Life, graphite on paper, 10\" x 8\" ©2011","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Ebba, charcoal on paper, 18\" x 14\" ©2011","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 10\" x 8\" ©2012","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Untiled, digital photography, 10\" x 8\" ©2012","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 10\" x 8\" ©2011","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Untitled, digital photography, 10\" x 8\" ©2012","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Window Series, digital photography, 21.5 x 12\" ©2013","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Window Seires -

Through these photos my hope is for the viewer to slow-down the rush and craziness of life and embrace simplicity.\n\ncbschieffelin@gmail.com."}},"76":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Cracks, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Individuality, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Jelly, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Grounded, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Whiskers, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Petal, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Mellow, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Crisp, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Heat, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Lower East Side, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Power, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Red, digital photography           ©2013","type":"image"}},"link":[0,11],"name":"Olivia Jacobsen","statement":{"type":"text","content":"For me, the snap of a camera shutter becomes the sound of magic.

My drawings and paintings depict realistic images of human figures, busts, or parts of the body in an unrealistic or distorted scenario. My art is beginning to turn from basic emotions visible on ones' shoulder to communicating thoughts that are much more abstract and complicated. That is, some of my pieces, especially my earlier works, portray a clear image of sadness, depression, pain, anger, or joy. More recent pieces cannot have just one word describe the emotion or thought behind them or the ideas depicted in them. Doing so creates a deeper piece of art which requires more thought from both myself and the viewer.\n\nThis process of placing thought onto canvas is my attempt to understand my own psyche and portray it to others through a visible medium.\n\nZachKamin94@gmail.com"}},"87":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Dalmation, watercolor pencils ©2012","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Pinneapple, oil pastel ©2012","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Orange, oil pastel ©2012","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Kiwi, oil pastel ©2012","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Frills, watercolor ©2012","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Squash Blossom, watercolor ©2012","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Blue Poppy, watercolor ©2012","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Parrot Tulip, watercolor ©2012","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Drape, watercolor ©2012","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Dark Bow, acrylic ©2012","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Bow, oil pastel ©2012","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Boxes, pencil ©2012","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Maggie Molloy","statement":{"type":"text","content":"My artwork takes inspiration from living things.

The final piece shows my impression of the organism at hand.\n\nMMolloy1124@gmail.com"}},"88":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Shmeegle, Ink,  \"9x6 \" ©2011","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Nikitty, Ink,  \"9x6 \" ©2011","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Dragon, Color Pencil,  \"9x6 \" ©2012","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Glow, Oil Paint,  \"16x20 \" ©2010","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, mixed medial,  \"20\" x 16\"\" ©2012","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Grace, Ink and Color Pencil,  \"9x6\" ©2012","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Careless, Ink,  \"9x6 \" ©2011","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Jack, Ink,  \"6x 9\" ©2011","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Crevis, Color Pencil,  \"9x6\" ©2012","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Koi, Color pencil,  \"9x6 \" ©2012","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Mountains, Ink,  \"6x9 \" ©2010","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"The Blocks,Ink,  \"9x6 \" ©2011","type":"image"}},"link":[0,0],"name":"Georgi Michaelessi","statement":{"type":"text","content":"My portraits are designed to capture and display emotion through my mark making.

Every aspect of these works are carefully composed so each has an aesthetically unique appearance. Being a musician myself, I was always intrigued by the visually rhythmic design of my baritone saxophone. How an instrument, built so meticulously, built with such care to detail, could produce a sound so unique and so strong; how the intentional patterns of such a classic design could directly influence the unexpected, exciting patterns of music. This curiosity was my inspiration for my music photographs.\n\ncontact info: hannahsallysolomon@gmail.com"}},"97":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Bees, watercolor & ink, 12\"x18\" ©2010","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Goons,  ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Sneaky,  ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Hiding, watercolor & ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Madame's Family, watercolor & ink, 12\"x18\" ©2011","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Hipster,  ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Nerve Deficiency,  ink, 12\"x18\" ©2011","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Gossip, watercolor & ink, 12\"x18\" ©2011","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Rompus, watercolor & ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Trousers, watercolor & ink, 24\"x18\" ©2011","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Boy and Turkey,  ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Grace, watercolor & ink, 18\"x12\" ©2011","type":"image"}},"link":[0,9],"name":"Charlotte Stickles","statement":{"type":"text","content":"For me, the goal of my art is one:\nTo paint and draw for prospect and fun.\nI hope that he who encounters it\nExperiences each characters' undeniable wit!\n\ncontact info: charlottestickles@gmail.com"}},"98":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Water Scream, Markers, 8\"x4\" ©2010","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Ouch, Markers, 8\"x4\" ©2010","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Hahaha Poooot, Markers, 12\"x11\" ©2010","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Scuba, Markers, 8\"x3.5\" ©2010","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Blaghh, Markers, 17\"x14\" ©2010","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Zap, Markers, 10.5\"x15\" ©2010","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Sad Grass, Markers, 6\"x2.5\" ©2010","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Aliens go BOOM, Markers, 20\"x21\" ©2010","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Devil Down Under, Markers, 20''x15.5'' ©2010","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Horn Krabby, Markers, 3\"x2.5\" ©2010","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"A Harmful Rainbow, Markers, 20\"x19.5\" ©2010","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Me and My Pal Rupert, Spray Painted with legal permission at 5 pts - LIC, Queens NYC, , 6'x4' ©2009","type":"image"}},"link":[0,11],"name":"Mackie O'Conor","statement":{"type":"text","content":"When creating my art pieces there are a few components I try to maintain.

Block","statement":{"type":"text","content":"In my pieces, I showed the development of emotion through colors within landscapes. In our lifetimes, we emote so much, and our emotions and how we express them define us. When we are young, we learn the categories of emotions: sad, happy, angry, scared…. However, emotions are so unique to us and our understanding of the world. They can blend, just like the world and nature. Thus, I used a story of two mountains to express different emotions and what they are like to me. My pieces follow two mountains, one smaller and one larger. We follow the journey of the small mountain becoming the larger mountain within my pieces: their envy, their grief, their hope. We can feel with the mountain and relate to it, having felt emotions like that of the mountain. We always strive to achieve a goal, and our journey to it is filled with fear, sadness, frustration, and a multitude of emotions as we traverse. You can also see throughout the pieces different color schemes for each emotion. Emotions, with their infinite complexities, can be colored in so many ways. We might think blue for sadness, but sadness can be a multitude of colors, and sadness is defined by so many factors. The colors I chose embody my emotional experience, and what I think the mountain would be feeling. All within the pieces, you can see the colors, the emotion, all within the journey through the trees, up slopes, and over the great ocean.\n\ncontact: eadinmblock@gmail.com"}},"112":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[10,4,5,9,2,3,1,6,0,7,11,8]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Belly Button, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2021","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Back, oil paint, 8x8 inches, 12x9 inches,","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Collarbones, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2020","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Arm, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2021","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Eye Bags, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2021","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Eye Bags, closeup, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2021","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Hands, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2020","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Lip, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2020","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Foot, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2020","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Ear, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2021","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"2021","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Legs, oil paint, 8x8 inches, ©2021","type":"image"}},"link":[0,9],"name":"Alicia Sang","statement":{"type":"text","content":"I have explored the dichotomy of nature, man-made processes, and how these man-made processes can impact nature.

My colour pallet and form is inspired by 1920s Eastern European expression. Red is a very prominent colour in my work, mostly because it’s an unavoidable one: it’s heavy, the colour of bloody earth. It is what ties the pieces together - although other colours will be muted, red prevails. The act of being dead isn’t featured heavily in this collection - moreso, I represent the interactions between our overwhelming emotions (grief, loss, disgust, elation) and our romanticised concept of dying."}},"120":{"galleries":[{"name":"2D work","order":[1,5,7,0,2,8,4,9,11,10,3,25]},{"name":"Charcoal","order":[14,12,13,16,17,18,24,19,21,22,23,20]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Малыш, digital ©2021","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Steps of Serenity, watercolor, 9x12 inches ©2019","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"World, pen, 8.5x11 inches ©2020","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Homage to Natasha Allegri, watercolor & charcoal, 5x7 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Space, acrylic on denim, 8.5x11 inches ©2020","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Quarantine, watercolor & digital ©2021","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Playful Opening, digital ©2021","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Floatful, watercolor, 8x12 inches ©2020","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Mercutio, digital ©2021","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Lados, digital ©2019","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"A Walk with a Friend, digital ©2019","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Protected, charcoal & graphite on paper, 24x18 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Encased, charcoal on canvas,20x20 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Strength, charcoal on paper, 7x9 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"Held, charcoal on paper, 12x12 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Untitled, charcoal & graphite on paper, 8.5x12 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Supported, charcoal on paper, 18x12 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Distance, charcoal & graphite on primed canvas, 10x8 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Untitled, charcoal  & graphite on primed canvas, 12x9 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Anxiety, charcoal on paper, 24x18 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Untitled, charcoal  & graphite on paper, 24x18 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Warmth, charcoal on paper, 24x18 inches ©2020","type":"image"},"24":{"name":"Sight, graphite on raw canvas, 20x20 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"25":{"name":"The Things We Miss, acrylic on canvas, 14x11 inches ©2021","type":"image"}},"link":[0,25],"name":"Victor Vyssotski","statement":{"type":"text","content":"2-D work Gallery:\nMy art attempts to capture what happiness is to me, whether it’s friends, loved ones, places, or experiences.

This series started as a more simplistic approach to romance with pieces such as ‘Protected’ and ‘Sight’ with joyful expressions on the subjects that are bathed in light. The view of the hospital room in the piece called ‘Anxiety’ begins a shift in the relationship where darkness and negative emotions are more prevalent due to a diagnosis of cancer in one of the subjects. After that point, light and dark are both used as the relationship has moments of hope and togetherness combined with fear and worry, as both subjects grow, learn, and change together to overcome obstacles.\n"}},"121":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[19,23,18,20,7,6,4,3,22,9,11,21]}],"images":{"3":{"name":"Untitled, micron pen on paper, 8x8 inches @2021","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Untitled, micron pen on paper, 9x8 inches @2021","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Untitled, oil painting 16x20 inches @2021","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Untitled, micron pen on paper, 9x8 inches @2021","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Untitled, watercolor, 14x10 inches @2020","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, acrylic, 14x11 inches ©2020","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Untitled, colored pencils on illustration board, 22x22 inches @2021","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Untitled, colored pencils on illustration board, 16x20 inches @2022","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Untitled, oil on canvas in frame, 40x24 inches @2022","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Untitled, oil pastels on illustration board, 22x22 inches @2022","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Untitled, oil on wood board, 20x16  inches @2021","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Untitled, gouache on illustration board, 20x16 inches @2022","type":"image"}},"link":[0,19],"name":"Nawel Acosta","statement":{"type":"text","content":"Through my art, I explore ways in which color can be used to broaden the interpretations we construct about art and how we make those interpretations understandable to ourselves and others.

My art visualizes the process of this change. The world we lived in as a child was a world full of bliss, where we believed in everything. As we grew up, we were expected to grow up a certain way by society and start doubting the world we once believed in. Fairy tales we read, stars we looked up to, and the sky we dreamed of flying in all turned against us. Blue is used to represent the sky in pieces that expressed the world of childhood, and to represent the ocean in pieces that expressed the process of the change, depicting the feeling of drowning under pressure of societal expectations to grow up. Because red is a powerful color, I used it to represent the strong emotions we feel in the pain and anger when society imposes this change on us. \n\nI’m sinking, but I’m learning to swim to see the sky again.\n"}},"135":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[2,4,3,5,8,6,12,10,11,7,9,13]}],"images":{"2":{"name":"A Pen Sketch of Leo James McLaughlin, pen on paper, 24x15 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"My Desk, and Hudson, Pencil 15x9 inches ©2021","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Eyeliner, oil on canvas 20x20 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Sean and Sy, Blank ink, 15x9  inches ©2022","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"A Butterfly Grip, Pencil 15x9 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Rene, black ink,15x9 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Reilly, Blank ink 15x9 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"A Rose in Charcoal, White charcoal 10x14 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Guns n Roses, Paint on Wood 18x24 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Dialectic (pt. 1), oil paint on canvas, 20x8 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Dialectic (pt. 2), oil paint on canvas, 20x8 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Stranded in Space, Blank ink 15x9 inches ©2022","type":"image"}},"link":[0,2],"name":"Alea Gray","statement":{"type":"text","content":"My artwork varies greatly in medium and style, but my progress over time is evident and I'm happy with my growth, and, I hope to learn more as I go.

Another example of this is Fading Childhood where I portray memories, longing of simpler times with muted color."}},"144":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[5,12,6,3,7,4,9,14,11,8,13,10]}],"images":{"3":{"name":"Sunflowers, oil on canvas, 24 x 16 inches, ©2022","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Glow in the Dark, mixed media, 20x15x15 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Untitled, oil on \\wood panel, 20 x 16 inches, ©2022","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"Bare, oil on canvas, 20 x 16 inches, ©2022","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Blue Hour, watercolor, 10 x 14 inches, ©2021","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"All Eyes are on You, gouache on paper, 24 x 18 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Glow in the Dark, mixed media, 20x15x15 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Untitled, oil on canvas, 40 x 50 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Untitled, oil on canvas, 40 x 30 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Untitled, oil on \\wood panel, 20 x 16 inches, ©2022","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Untitled, oil on canvas, 24 x 16 inches, ©2022","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Aftermath, white charcoal on paper, 8 x 10 inches ©2022","type":"image"}},"link":[0,10],"name":"Sherry Chen","statement":{"type":"text","content":"Through experimentation in medium, composition, size, color, I slowly develop a common theme and style across my art.

The further we advance technologically, the further we move away from what makes us human. To be human is to interact, to love, to breathe, and to grow. Whereas technology has provided us with countless benefits, it has also dehumanized us through addiction, temptation, solitude, unethical practices, and mental degradation. It is imperative to highlight these dangers so that we can maintain what makes humanity beautiful amidst the exponential growth and grip of technology.\n\nThe perils of technology can be physical or psychological. I experimented with two media to reveal this duality. Oil paints expose the powerful, physiological menace of bullying, addiction, and child labor. I employed bold brush strokes and intense colors to denote the subjects and juxtaposed those with abstract backgrounds to focus on the threats. Watercolors convey the more subtle, psychological yet equally powerful dangers of online dating, social awkwardness, and selfies. Together, the pieces affirm the capacity of technology to alienate us from our humanity."}},"148":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]},{"name":"2","order":[17,16,19,15,14,12,13,18,20,22,21,23]}],"images":{"12":{"name":"In Between, watercolor, 9x12 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Lampshade, wire and rice paper, ©2024","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Study of Snake, white charcoal, 24x18 inches, ©2024","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Mom and Dad, watercolor, 9x12 inches each, ©2023","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"If I Were a Hummingbird, acrylic on canvas, 16x20 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Cheese! acrylic on canvas, 16x20 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"Self Portrait, charcoal on newsprint, 18x24 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Sweet Peas, acrylic on canvas, 16x20 inches, ©2024","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Self Portrait, charcoal thumbprints on newsprint, 18x24 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"The Fairy, acrylic on canvas, 14x11 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Blue Raspberry, acrylic in canvas, 16x20 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Sleepover, acrylic on canvas, 16x20 inches, ©2023","type":"image"},"24":{"name":"Asian Cowboy, acrylic on canvas, 16x24 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"25":{"name":"Asian Cowboy close up, acrylic on canvas, 16x24 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"26":{"name":"Bliss, acrylic on canvas, 20x30 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"27":{"name":"Luna Visits the Stars, acrylic on canvas, 10x10 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"28":{"name":"Eyes of Them All, acrylic on canvas, 20x16 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"29":{"name":"Portrait of Evie & Sophia, acrylic on canvas, 20x16 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"30":{"name":"Portrait of Samantha, acrylic on canvas, 16x20 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"31":{"name":"Sardines, acrylic on canvas, 14x11 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"32":{"name":"Dum-Dum, graphite & pen on graph paper & construction paper, 15x11 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"33":{"name":"Portrait of Mars, acrylic, graph paper & tissue paper on construction paper, 18x12 inches, ©2025","type":"image"},"34":{"name":"White Noise, acrylic on canvas, 24 x 20 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"35":{"name":"White Noise, close up, acrylic on canvas, 24 x 20 inches, ©2024","type":"image"}},"link":[0,33],"name":"Minori Furtado","statement":{"type":"text","content":"How has the digital era overwhelmed the consciousness of the new generation?In the modern digital age, there is a wealth of information at the fingertips of the new generation.

Most of my pieces also include heavy use of blue as the background or accent color. Because blue is a color that rarely exists in nature, it can be very eye-catching while conveying numerous emotions from tranquility to sorrow. I use a variety of drawing and painting mediums in my work, though my preferred medium is oil paint. I focus in most of my pieces on making very smooth blended marks, to create realistic images; however, I have also experimented with using intentional brushstrokes to create texture. It’s very important for me to use my art to discuss issues that are relevant to me. My goal with a lot of my art is to create a statement. For example, I created five paintings of endangered species to bring awareness to conservation.

In a world that demands so much of us, to work, to be productive, and to earn and provide for ourselves 24/7, isolation is a privilege that has been marked as worthless.

I successfully make my audience aware of similarities among humans, and reflect upon their own identities and values through various techniques. The charcoal piece of a girl is a representation of joyful and playful friendships, which I convey through the images obscure angle. The charcoal piece of the fingers is a representation of intimate emotion achieved through a close up perspective, specifically emotions that present themselves discreetly. These fingers are drawn as if the person were picking at the skin of their thumb, a habit due to stress. In the watercolor with the phrase “Say I love you”, the need for love and human connection, along with the betterment of human kind with this love, is conveyed through radiant coloring. The watercolor of a cityscape conveys a sense of isolation, particularly in public settings, due to the vast buildings and silent streets. The watercolor with the two matching dolphins is a comment on sibling relationships, as they are owned by my brother and I, who is now away at college. Facing them away from each other represents the distance that grows between familial relationships at particular points in life. My series, composed of three charcoal pieces, aims at representing the same overarching theme in regards to human relationships, but particularly involving communication technology and the way they are embedded in our day to day lives. \n"}},"161":{"galleries":[{"name":"Red","order":[12,19,20,13,14,16,22,18,17,15,23,21]},{"name":"Nature","order":[11,2,0,3,8,1,7,5,10,6,4,9]},{"name":"Copics","order":[33,32,26,27,25,29,30,35,28,31,34,24]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"A Different Perspective, watercolor, gauche, markers, and color pencil on paper, 12 x 12 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Flowers Statues, water color on paper ©2021","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"Jellyfish Princess: oil pastel, markers, and color pencil on wood panel, 12 x 9 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Moon and Sun, gouache, markers, color pencil and pen on paper, 8 x 4 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"A View, gouache and pen on paper, 8x10 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"Childhood Tree, crayon, 5x5x5 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"6":{"name":"The Watcher, acrylic on wood board, 9x12 inches ©2025","type":"image"},"7":{"name":"Ghibli Fantasy, mixed media, 5x10x4 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"8":{"name":"Figure Drawing, pen, markers, and ink on paper, 13 x 5 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"9":{"name":"Nature Study 1, pencil on paper, 8x10 inches ©2020","type":"image"},"10":{"name":"Angel With Wings, acrylic on wood board, 9x12 inches ©2025","type":"image"},"11":{"name":"Self Portrait, watercolor on paper, 14 x 10 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"12":{"name":"Angel Wings: wax, 3x4x5 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"13":{"name":"Inside, clay, 4x10x6 inches ©2022","type":"image"},"14":{"name":"Coming Together, gouache, color pencil, and chalk on paper ©2022","type":"image"},"15":{"name":"Reflection - Perspective, gouache on paper , 12 x 14 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"16":{"name":"The Hug, print, 24 x 18 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"17":{"name":"Daffodils, oil on wood board, acrylic flowers, 20 x 20 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"18":{"name":"RBG Woman, acrylic on wood board, 20 x 16 inches ©2025","type":"image"},"19":{"name":"Angel with a Light, mixed media, 3x4x5 inches ©2025","type":"image"},"20":{"name":"Thinking Skeleton, balsa wood structure, pencil, pen, and marker on paper ©2023","type":"image"},"21":{"name":"Self Portrait - Boundaries, acrylic on wood board and sculpty clay ©2024","type":"image"},"22":{"name":"Angel In Red, acrylic on wood board, 10x10 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"23":{"name":"Self Portrait, oil on canvas, 12 x 12 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"24":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"25":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"26":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"27":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"28":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"29":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"30":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"31":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"32":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"33":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"34":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"35":{"name":"Study from Internet Photo, copic markers, 8.5 x 11 inches ©2024","type":"image"}},"link":[0,19],"name":"Amber Lai","statement":{"type":"text","content":"Gallery 1\n\nFor this portfolio, I mainly focused on the sense of desire. However, the meaning of these works is subjective. I work in multiple different types of media. I also enjoy exploring the different ways of expressing my ideas through these media. When I make art, I don't have a planned schedule on how and when I will finish the pieces. However, I do have some structure in how I make art. I always start with thumbnail sketches to see which composition I like the most, but for the rest of the process, it depends on how I want the piece to look. For example, the piece, Coming Together was made out of gouache, colored pencil, and chalk because I believed it was the best way to express my idea. After my thumbnail sketches, I usually test out which colors work the best and what textures to use to add detail to the piece. The main reason why I created this work is because it can express my feelings and opinions. However, sometimes I make these pieces because it's aesthetically pleasing or because I want to try out a new medium. \n\n\nGallery 2\n\nIn this portfolio, the majority were influenced by nature. Similar to the first portfolio, these artworks are usually a variety of media, or whatever looks the best for expressing my idea. For example, the piece \"Childhood Tree\" was made out of crayons because crayons represent childhood for me. However, some media were assigned to me and were just practice. For the artwork influenced by nature, I used references to keep some realistic aspects to the piece. Just like the first portfolio, I also use thumbnail sketches to make my idea clear and planned out. A difference in this portfolio compared to the previous one, was that I layered a lot and spent time working on each layer before starting a new one. I mainly made these works because I had an idea I wanted to express or because I wanted to study nature.

My art reflects who I am—someone shaped by two cultures, constantly navigating between them, and finding beauty in that space in-between.\n\nA lot of my work is connected to my heritage. I incorporate details from traditional patterns, home-cooked meals, and the kinds of buildings I grew up seeing in my family’s home country. It’s my way of preserving memories and honoring where I come from, while also making something new. My pieces tell stories of growing up as a first-generation American, learning to carry pride and responsibility, and figuring out where I fit.\n\nOver time, my interest in design and structure led me to architecture. I started making models that combined my love for art and my curiosity about how things are built. I’m especially drawn to sustainable and community-focused spaces—buildings that feel alive and serve a purpose beyond just existing. Therfoam-core, cardboard, and whatever else I can handle, I handle ideas representing bigger goals: connection, culture, and environmental care.\n\nWhether drawing, painting, or building, I always come back to the same thing—telling stories through space and form.

I enjoy working with direct opposites and exploring how they can also compliment each other so well.\n"}},"181":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,2,6,9,5,10,7,1,3,11,8,4]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Jaws, paper mache and acrylic, 20x36x8 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Can Lanterns, light and soda cans, 8x8x3 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"2":{"name":"The Shining, fabrics on canvas, 24x18 inches ©2025","type":"image"},"3":{"name":"Sahara, mixed media, 10x10 inches ©2024","type":"image"},"4":{"name":"Hallway, copic markers and micron pens on paper, 18 x 12 inches ©2023","type":"image"},"5":{"name":"T.J.

I make my work from reference photos, except the piece we had to do from imagination. With my art, I hope to create a visual representation of myself and my inner thoughts. I want people to look at my art pieces and think about me, and what I did to create the piece. I have a zest for life in general, and to me, art is such a meaningful way to express my love for my friends and family and myself. I love to create art so that people can look at it and see a moment in my life, something that meant something to me--or didn’t, because life is a mix of both and I like to show both. I don't remember taking that photo in front of my mirror, but I did, so it was important to me at some point. That makes it important to me now; important enough to make a piece of art out of it."}},"183":{"galleries":[{"name":"1","order":[0,7,10,6,9,1,2,3,4,5,8,11]}],"images":{"0":{"name":"Beetle Invasion, oil painting 10 x 12 inches ©2025","type":"image"},"1":{"name":"Miss.

Sometimes my pieces are made from the left behind bits or already used materials, and I enjoy the idea of turning something old into something new. I always try to make the most out of what I have and try to use even the smallest scraps I have left to not let anything go to waste.

I believe the meaning of artwork should be up to everyone's interpretation, and I just try to make some fun art. I enjoy having varied pieces and learning new techniques and styles."}}}
